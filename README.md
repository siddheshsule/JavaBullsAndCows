# Bulls and Cows...A Java program...

The program asks the player to enter length and number of alphanumeric characters. The player is supposed to guess the code. If the guessed character is anywhere in the secret code, its termed as a 'cow'
and if the character is in the secret code and has a same place value, it is termed as a 'bull'!

The program catches all the exceptions and does'nt crash under any error!
Sounds interesting, is'nt it?..Give it a try....
